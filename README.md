# Fetch Android Internship

The Hiring Data App is an Android application that fetches data from a remote JSON endpoint and displays it in a grouped format. The application fetches the data asynchronously and organizes it based on the "listId" field. Each group of data is expandable, allowing users to view the individual items within each group.

# Features
* Display all the items grouped by "listId"
* Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
* Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

# Installation
* Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hiring-data-app.git

* Open the project in Android Studio.
* Build and run the application on an Android emulator or device.
